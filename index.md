# City Science Laboratory

The City Science Laboratory is a multidisciplinary research group within the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Bologna. The Laboratory brings together expertise in physics, mathematics, and computer science to investigate the complexity of urban systems. With a focus on mobility, climate, and energy, it aims to advance sustainable and resilient cities through scientific methodologies, computational tools, and the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms, which are increasingly transforming the analysis and management of urban environments.
The Laboratory collaborates with CINECA, one of Europeâ€™s leading high- performance computing centers, on several urban Digital Twin initiatives. Among these, the Digital Twin of the City of Bologna integrates heterogeneous datasets and advanced modeling techniques to generate insights for urban planning, climate adaptation, and energy efficiency.
Key research areas include the analysis of Urban LiDAR, Orthophotos, Satellite Data, and other Remote Sensing sources; the study of Infrastructure Morphology and Indicators; the development of Vegetation and Climate Vulnerability Indices; Building Energy Simulations; Urban Microclimate Modeling; Vehicular Mobility Modeling; and Pedestrian Dynamics and Crowd Analysis.
By combining advanced computational methods with real-world applications, the City Science Laboratory fosters collaboration with public and private stakeholders to address critical urban challenges and promote evidence-based decision-making.
