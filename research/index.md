# Research Activities at the City Science Lab

- Network theory and random walks<br>
We study the dynamics of complex networks using random walk models to explore node connectivity, community structure, and diffusion processes. Applications include urban infrastructure, mobility systems, and energy distribution.

- Urban vehicular mobility modeling<br>
We develop large-scale simulations of traffic flow across various cities, e.g. Bologna, to forecast congestion patterns and optimize traffic lights and routing strategies. The model integrates real traffic data from heterogeneous sources and adaptive control mechanisms to improve urban mobility efficiency.

- Railway delay prediction using Italian train data<br>
We analyze national train schedules and historical delay records to build a simple model able to replicate the empirical distribution of delays. This model can be used to predict future delays and improve the reliability of the railway system.

- Building energy simulation<br>
We simulate energy consumption for the buildings in Bologna based on their geometry and age. The output is used to map the cityâ€™s most energy-demanding and polluting zones, supporting decarbonization strategies and policymaking.

- Urban vegetation analysis<br>
We extract information on urban trees using airborne LiDAR, including segmentation of individual trees and updates of tree features such as height and crown radius. This helps maintain accurate vegetation inventories and assess urban green coverage.

- Urban Heat Island (UHI) analysis<br>
We study the urban heat island effect using spatial variables like Sky View Factor (SVF). The aim is to understand microclimate variation across urban zones and identify heat-vulnerable areas for climate adaptation planning.
