I am Matteo Falcioni, a research fellow at the University of Bologna. I deal with artificial intelligence and machine learning applied to geospatial data analysis, with a focus on the use of deep learning models to support urban applications. My interests include neural networks for spatial data classification and generative models for the simulation and optimisation of urban scenarios.
